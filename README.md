# Kidney_Image_Classification
Kidney_Image_Classification is a deep learning project focused on detecting four key kidney conditions from medical imaging: Cyst, Normal, Stone, and Tumor. The model is built using ResNet50, a powerful convolutional neural network architecture pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for medical image classification.
